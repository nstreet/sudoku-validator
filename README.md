# sudoku-validator
trivial illustrations of alternative approaches to a script to validate a sudoku square

At a job interview I was once asked to demonstrate how I would write a script to validate a sudoku square. I now ask the same question of candidates that I interview as a means of understanding how they go about stuff. By way of eating my own dog food, I thought I'd better do it myself. I did it in python years ago (after the interview) and I'll probably put the code here when I find it.

Although I think my validator script was pretty cool, I didn't get the job :-)
