# tests and test resources  
all tests and test resources are here. the src directory contains shunit2 (courtesy of https://github.com/kward/shunit2.git). I include it here just for ease of use.

## to run the tests  
in this directory just run the test_sudokuSquare.sh script
the output might look a bit messy but the idea is to try to illuminate the errors as they are detected.
