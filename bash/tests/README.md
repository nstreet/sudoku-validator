# tests and test resources  
all tests and test resources are here. the src directory contains shunit2 (courtesy of https://github.com/kward/shunit2.git). I include it here just for ease of use.

## to run the tests  
in this directory just run the test_sudokuSquare.sh script
the output might look a bit messy but the idea is to try to illuminate the errors as they are detected.

## a bit about TDD  
I have tried to be diligent about how I go about "developing" this. I know it is just an exercise but it has been useful to me. I think, without a Test Driven Development approach, the elapsed time would have been so much longer and, I think the quality would be even less good than it is. In retrospect, I should have been even more diligent. I think there may be some elements of the overall design that would have been improved if I had written many more tests before commencing on writing the code to make them pass. Alas, we all like to see progress sooner rather than later!
